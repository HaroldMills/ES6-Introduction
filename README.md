# ES6-Introduction
This repository contains slides and code samples from an introduction to ES6 (aka ECMAScript 2015) I presented at the Ithaca Web People meeting on November 1, 2016.

To view the slides, open the file `introduction-to-ES6.html` in your favorite web browser.

Thanks to the [Remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) project for their wonderful browser-based slideshow tool!
